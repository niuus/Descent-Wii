# Descent-Wii
 Descent port for the Wii
 
 Original code by tueidj
 
## Game files
To play this port, you need the original game files from a registered copy (updated to version 1.4a or 1.5) or use the Descent Anniversary Edition CD. These files called DESCENT.PIG and DESCENT.HOG, must be placed in the /apps/descent/ folder. You cannot use the shareware version files or the "Destination Saturn" release.

The game will perform checksum verification at startup to make sure they are correct. You can purchase "Descent" from Good Old Games, which is 100% compatible.
